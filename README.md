# Diabetic Patient Readmission Trends & Dashboard: Identifying High-Risk Patients, Departments, and Clinical Drivers
***

## Project Overview ☰

This project analyzes ten years of diabetic patient hospitalization data from 130 U.S. hospitals to identify patterns and drivers of readmission within 30 days. The analysis focuses on patient demographics, clinical complexity, hospital department performance, and specialty-level risk, combining data cleaning, feature engineering, pivot tables, and interactive Excel dashboards. Insights support targeted interventions, optimized care coordination, and evidence-based hospital decision-making to reduce readmission rates and improve patient outcomes.

## Key Takeaways 🔎

       ✓ Over 45% of hospitalizations involve repeat admissions, with 11.16% readmitted within 30 days and 34.93% after 30 days  
       ✓ Specialty-level analysis identifies high-risk areas, including Allergy & Immunology (42.86%) and Resident-managed cases (50%)  
       ✓ Departments with longer average length of stay, such as Pediatrics-Allergy & Immunology (12.67 days), may require focused discharge planning  
       ✓ Readmission rates vary by age and demographics, highlighting populations for precision monitoring and culturally sensitive interventions  
       ✓ Patients with multiple comorbidities show sharply higher readmission risk, supporting complex patient care coordination  

## Key Features 🔑

       ✓ Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing, blank, and unknown values  
       ✓ Creation of a readmission_flag feature to standardize outcome analysis  
       ✓ Pivot table and chart analysis for readmission by specialty, age, number of diagnoses, and length of stay  
       ✓ Development of an interactive Excel dashboard integrating pivot tables, slicers, and visualizations for hospital decision-makers  
       ✓ Synthesis of actionable insights to guide interventions, care planning, and risk stratification for high-risk patients  

## Technologies Used 🛠️

       ✓ Microsoft Excel  
       ✓ Excel PivotTables, PivotCharts, and Dashboards  
       ✓ Data cleaning and feature engineering  
       ✓ Descriptive statistics and demographic analysis  
       ✓ Charting and visualization (pie charts, histograms, line charts, horizontal bar charts)
